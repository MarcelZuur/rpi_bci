Running an experiment
---------------------
Instructions on how to run an experiment, make sure that all software dependencies are installed and the hardware is
correctly connected (see 1.3) and turned on. The calibration stimulus and feedback stimulus have to be run on the
Raspberry Pi, while other files could potentially be run on a different device if the ip/port of the buffer is modified
(see 1.2).

From the buffer_bci/dataAcq folder:

1. Start a buffer in the buffer_bci/dataAcq folder, e.g. by running startJavaBuffer.bat for windows (startJavaBuffer.sh for linux).
2. Start an EEG data gathering file dependent on the EEG device used, e.g startMobita when using a mobita device or startEmotiv when using an emotiv device.

From the rpi_bci folder:

3. Start the signal processor by running SigProc.py, this will run continuously.
4. Start the calibration phase by running CalibrationStimulus.py, and wait for it to finish.
5. Start the classifier training phase by running TrainClassifier.py, and wait for it to finish.
6. Start the feedback phase by running FeedBackStimulus.py, this will run continuously.


Settings
---------
The different settings that can be easily modified are in the settings.ini file.
